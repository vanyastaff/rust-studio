# /team-async — design & ship an async service feature

Orchestrate the async team through structured phases. **Delegate all file writes to
sub-agents; the orchestrator never writes.** Gate at phase boundaries (quality gates,
not permission loops — see `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/docs/coordination-protocol.md` §1, §8).

## Orchestration
When agent teams are available (`CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS`), run this as a real
team: `TeamCreate`, then spawn the named agents as teammates and coordinate via the shared
task list (`TaskCreate` one task per phase, order with `addBlockedBy`, assign with
`TaskUpdate owner`) + `SendMessage`. Otherwise fall back to single-orchestrator delegation:
spawn sub-agents sequentially and inline each phase's context into the spawn prompt. Teammates
don't inherit this plan (pass it in the spawn prompt) and don't get bundled MCP (they rely on
the user's ambient serena/exa); status can lag, so have teammates mark tasks `completed`.
Drive `TeamDelete` cleanup at the end (shut teammates down with `SendMessage
{type:"shutdown_request"}` first).

## Team composition
`async-systems-lead` (owns ASYNC-GATE) · `async-runtime-specialist` · `web-framework-specialist`
· `database-specialist` · `observability-engineer` · `rust-scout` (locates) · `rust-builder` (writes) · `rust-reviewer` (audits).

Create one task per phase via `TaskCreate`; chain them with `addBlockedBy` (1 → 2 → 3 → 4 →
5 → 6) and assign each to its owning agent with `TaskUpdate owner`. Where a phase fans out
across specialists, create sibling tasks (same blocker, no dependency between them) so they
run concurrently as teammates; the lead synthesizes when all report via `SendMessage`.

## Phase 1 — Scope & scout
- Restate the feature and its acceptance criteria in 1–3 bullets. If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty,
  ask: "What async service feature should we build?" and suggest `/architecture` or
  `/brainstorm` for broad explorations.
- Task owned by **`rust-scout`** to map existing async infrastructure: entry-points, runtime
  initialization, handler registration, connection pools, middleware chains, and existing
  tests. Scout uses serena MCP for symbol/reference navigation and `rg` for macro-generated
  or `cfg`-gated sites — never Bash `grep`/`find`. (As a teammate, scout uses the user's
  ambient serena — it is not bundled into the spawn.)

## Phase 2 — Design (blocked by 1)
- Task owned by `async-systems-lead` (with `async-runtime-specialist`) to draft the runtime
  topology: executor strategy (Tokio runtime shape, worker threads, `LocalSet` if needed),
  spawning model (`tokio::spawn` vs. structured tasks), and cancellation model.
- Sibling task — `web-framework-specialist` sketches the endpoint surface: routes,
  request/response types, middleware chain, and error response shape.
- Sibling task — `database-specialist` drafts the data flow: connection pool configuration,
  query patterns, and transaction boundaries at the async boundary.
- Present **2–4 design approaches** with trade-offs (simplicity vs. scalability, monolithic
  handler vs. actor model, connection-per-request vs. pooled, etc.).
- **Gate:** `AskUserQuestion` — show options, get direction on runtime topology and endpoint
  approach. Decide tactical details (channel sizes, field names, error variants) yourself;
  state choice + one-line rationale and proceed.

## Phase 3 — Architecture check (blocked by 2)
- `async-systems-lead` confirms boundaries with `chief-architect` if the feature spans
  crates, introduces a new binary entry-point, or changes the runtime configuration shared
  by other subsystems.
- Record an ADR (`/adr`) for non-trivial decisions (e.g. runtime flavor, actor vs.
  direct-await, backpressure strategy).
- Draft the async service design doc (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/docs/templates/architecture.md`).
- **Gate:** `AskUserQuestion` — present the design doc summary; proceed once approved.

## Phase 4 — Build (blocked by 3; parallel where independent)
- `rust-builder` implements all components under direction of `async-systems-lead` — all
  writes go through it. Instruct the builder to:
  - work test-driven where practical (failing test → implement → refactor),
  - stay strictly in scope (no opportunistic refactors),
  - add `// SAFETY:` notes to any `unsafe` and flag it for `unsafe-auditor`.
- Parallelize independent work streams where the design permits — create one sibling task per
  stream so they run concurrently; each specialist drives, `rust-builder` writes:
  - **Handlers/routes** — `web-framework-specialist` drives; `rust-builder` writes the
    handler functions, extractors, middleware, and error-response mapping.
  - **Database layer** — `database-specialist` drives; `rust-builder` writes the query
    functions, pool initialization, and transaction wrappers.
  - **Instrumentation** — `observability-engineer` drives; `rust-builder` writes tracing
    spans, structured log fields, and metric counters/histograms.
- Each stream reports a diff summary via `SendMessage` when complete. Hold all diffs until the
  parallel streams finish, then present them together.
- **Gate:** `AskUserQuestion` — show the combined draft diff before proceeding to validation.

## Phase 5 — Validate (blocked by 4)
- `rust-reviewer` audits the full diff.
- `async-systems-lead` runs the **ASYNC-GATE** checklist:
  - No blocking operations (I/O, `std::thread::sleep`, mutex-held-across-await, `block_on`)
    inside async contexts — cite file:line for any found.
  - All spawned tasks are cancellation-safe or documented as not-safe with a clear rationale.
  - `Send` + `'static` bounds are correct on every spawned future; no `Rc`/non-`Send` types
    leak across await points.
  - Backpressure is considered on every channel and connection pool; unbounded channels are
    explicitly justified.
  - Timeout and deadline propagation is present at service boundaries.
- Run and cite the output of:
  - `cargo nextest run` (fall back to `cargo test`) including any async integration tests.
  - `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`.
  - `cargo fmt --check`.
- If `unsafe` was introduced, spawn `unsafe-auditor` and require SAFETY-GATE clearance.
- If findings are NEEDS WORK, hand them back to `rust-builder` (loop Phase 4) until clean or
  the user decides to stop.

## Phase 6 — Sign-off (blocked by 5)
- Summary: the final handler surface, runtime topology chosen, database layer design,
  observability instrumentation added, ASYNC-GATE status, and test evidence. Every teammate's
  contribution ends in **COMPLETE / NEEDS WORK / BLOCKED** with evidence.
- Verdict **COMPLETE / NEEDS WORK / BLOCKED**. Next steps: `/review` for a deeper audit,
  `/perf` if latency or throughput is sensitive, `/changelog` if user-facing, `/publish` if
  release-bound.
- If running as a team, drive cleanup: `SendMessage {type:"shutdown_request"}` to each
  teammate, then `TeamDelete`.

## Error recovery
Any agent returns **BLOCKED** → surface it, don't proceed past it (its dependent tasks stay
blocked), `AskUserQuestion` (skip & note / retry narrower / stop and run the prerequisite).
Keep completed work.
