# Working Preferences — the studio's operating mode

Distilled from how this studio's owner actually wants AI engineers to work, learned across
several large solo Rust workspaces. The **engineering principles** are universal Rust quality
bars. The **operating mode** section encodes defaults you can tune. Every agent and skill
should honor this; `coordination-protocol.md` references it.

For non-trivial implementation work, this document is paired with the mandatory
`maintainer-grade-development.md` pre-code standard. That standard makes architecture,
crate ownership, Rust API idiom, performance posture, current-doc freshness, and strict
maintainer rejection checks happen **before** code is written rather than as a cleanup pass.

## Operating mode (the defaults — tune to taste)

### Autonomy: decide, don't interrogate
The owner runs as a **solo AI-orchestrator**: agents are the development workforce. After
strategic direction is set, **execute end-to-end** — don't ask a question per tactical step.

- **Decide yourself** (state the choice + a one-line rationale, then proceed): API form
  (`Stream` vs callback), drop semantics, channel sizes, internal struct layout, feature-flag
  names, tracing fields, error-variant shapes, test framework choices, file naming — anything
  resolvable by Rust ecosystem best practice + the established constraints.
- **Ask only when load-bearing**: a direction-changing fork (new crate vs in-place, naming
  conventions not implied by existing code, scope cuts), an **irreversible** action (data loss,
  `cargo publish`, out-of-repo edits), an **outward** action (push, open PR), or a fundamental
  design conflict that would make the next 30 min of work meaningless.
- **Batch** unavoidable decisions into one ask; present decisions-made + results, not a stream
  of questions. After ~3–4 strategic clarifying questions land scope/structure, **stop asking
  and start writing**.
- Autonomy is about **deciding, not skipping process** — keep the SDD/TDD discipline, the
  gates, and the verification. Commit locally without asking; still confirm anything outward.

> This refines the protocol's "Question → Options → Decision → Draft → Approval": run it as a
> *quality* loop, not a *permission* loop. Gates exist to catch bad work, not to ask permission
> for tactical calls. Reserve `AskUserQuestion` for genuine forks and irreversible/outward steps.

### Active-development mode: never minimize scope
Most work here is active development of a solo-owned workspace, not a frozen prod release. That
changes what "done" means:

- **No quick wins.** Doing the cheap half of a refactor and deferring the cross-crate ripple
  with an excuse ("busywork", "would touch crate X") is *fear wearing a generic parameter*, not
  engineering. Execute the full migration including breaking ripples. A deferral is only honest
  if it names a **concrete** blocker (needs a dev-dep, CI infra, a derive macro of its own scope)
  — not a comfort-level excuse.
- **Finish properly.** No orphaned files, legacy aliases, stub traits, or "I'll update the other
  half next commit" half-states. Align the whole file to the target shape in the same pass.
- **Green tests ≠ done.** Tests prove you didn't break what was tested; they don't prove the
  change is correct, complete, or well-shaped. **Don't claim done** if planned removals/refactors
  were skipped — if you skip something, say so explicitly ("skipping X because Y").
- **Think ahead + look sideways.** Before a new helper, check whether a sibling crate already
  owns the primitive — finish the partial version, don't fork one. Ask "if I maintained this for
  two years and extended it three times, what would I wish I'd done now?" Then do that while the
  context is loaded.
- **Prefer more-ideal over more-expedient.** "Works better" beats "works now" unless there's a
  real (not self-imposed) time constraint.

### Breaking changes: solo workspace vs published crate
- **Solo / unpublished / active-dev workspace**: hard breaking changes are *preferred* when they
  land the correct shape. **No compat shims, no adapter/bridge layers, no `#[deprecated]` aliases,
  no "migrate later" TODOs.** Replace the wrong thing; present the breaking change + its blast
  radius. CI is the safety net; ripple cost is bounded.
- **Published crate (crates.io / external consumers)**: semver discipline from `rules/api.md`
  applies — `#[non_exhaustive]`, sealing, deprecation windows, `cargo semver-checks`. Know which
  mode you're in before you break a signature.

## Engineering principles (universal Rust quality bar)

### Modern idiom currency
Verify idioms against the **current** toolchain (edition 2024; check official Rust release
notes/std docs for the current stable version), not pre-2025 habit.
Prefer the modern form and justify if you don't:
- Native **async-fn-in-trait / RPITIT** over the `async-trait` crate (keep `async-trait` only
  where `dyn` dispatch genuinely needs it).
- Typed errors (`thiserror`) over `Box<dyn Error>` / `anyhow` / `String` in **library** APIs.
- Don't reach for `Arc<Mutex<T>>` or `Rc<RefCell<T>>` as the *default* shared-state shape.
- `OnceLock`/`LazyLock`, `let-else`, `let-chains`, GATs where they fit.
- **Structural enforcement over discipline**: make the wrong path *syntactically absent*
  (tighten visibility, delete the bypass fn, scope borrows, `!Send`/`!Clone` markers, newtypes)
  rather than adding a "remember to call the safe helper" method.

### The four recurring idiom misses (scan before committing)
1. **Single-lookup `entry` API.** `map.entry(k).or_default()` once — not `get(&k)` then a second
   `entry()` lookup on miss.
2. **`expect`/`panic!`/`unreachable!` messages name the broken invariant**, not the function.
   `expect("next_id seeded at 0 — must start at 1 per ID-offset invariant")`, not
   `expect("next_id must be non-zero")`. The message is the only diagnostic when it trips.
3. **`Vec` has no small-buffer optimization** — `push` always heap-allocates. Don't treat a
   `Vec`/`Box`/`HashMap` field as inline in memory accounting; the struct holds only the header.
   Use `smallvec`/`arrayvec` or a `Single|Many` enum when inline-size-1 matters.
4. **Complexity comments state average AND worst case**, with a bounding note when N is bounded
   (`O(N) avg, O(N²) worst; bounded to N=16 → 256 probes max`). "O(N)" alone misleads the next
   author who extends to N=10000.

### Observability is Definition-of-Done
A change that adds/modifies a state, error variant, hot path, or cross-crate call ships its
observability **in the same pass**: a typed error variant (`#[source]` chains, not `String`),
a `#[tracing::instrument]`/span with the right fields, and an invariant turned into a
`debug_assert!`/type-level guarantee where it lived only in prose. Shipping without is silent
debt that only surfaces in prod (the "70% problem" / happy-path bias).

### Evidence over opinion
- **Architectural decisions want data**, not a lead with an opinion: crates.io adoption /
  reverse-deps / maintenance cadence, what 3–5 peer projects actually do, upstream open-issue
  audits. When the owner asks "what do others do?" they want the data pulled, not a stall.
- **Read the authoritative layer first.** Before any architecture deliberation, read the
  project's canon / ADRs / `docs/`. Read *all* of `docs/`, not just `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- **Never assert a filesystem/existence negative** ("no ADR covers this", "that folder doesn't
  exist") from an inference or a glob that didn't match — verify with a direct, exact-path check.
  An unverified false negative reads as lying.
- **Verify the owner's framing of their own code** against the source before building on it —
  people misread their own control flow.

### Adversarial review, not echo chamber
- For security-sensitive designs (secrets crossing a boundary, generic user-controlled input,
  cross-crate trust handoff), run an **abuse-case pass before presenting**: confused deputy,
  exfiltration, SSRF, privilege escalation, injection, tampering. Prefer structural defenses
  (can't be constructed without the safety property; deny-by-default).
- **Expert/review panels must attack**, not validate — seat genuine critics with opposing
  positions; put alternative decompositions on the table; let the current design survive only if
  it wins the argument. But panel output is a **proposal**, gated against the owner's literal
  scope — don't let it invent requirements ("like MCP" = conceptual analogy, not "implement the
  MCP wire protocol").
- When an audit looks **clean, look harder** before declaring victory — cross-check against the
  frozen spec/acceptance contract, not just "what the code does today". There's almost always a
  real gap or unenforced clause worth surfacing.
- For breaking / public-API / kernel-level PRs, dispatch **multiple review lenses in parallel**
  (architecture, migration-risk, API/semver) — they routinely catch correctness bugs that
  clippy/tests/CI miss. (See `/review`.)
- **But don't over-report.** A reviewer/critic asked to find gaps will find some even when the
  work is sound. Flag only what affects **correctness, security, or the stated requirements**;
  treat style and "could be more abstract" as optional. Chasing every finding produces the
  unnecessary abstractions and defensive bloat vanya explicitly rejects (no future-proofing).

### Boundaries & ADRs
- **Boundary erosion**: before adding a helper/const/type, ask "which crate owns this concept?"
  If not the one you're editing, place it correctly or make the boundary break explicit in the
  plan — not in a diff comment. Re-exports leaking a dependency's types through your public API
  are boundary breaks. Respect one-way layer direction; never reach upward.
- **ADRs are revisable** during active dev. If following an ADR forces a workaround/shim, the
  ADR is the bug — **supersede it** (new ADR "supersedes ADR-NNNN" with fresh evidence), don't
  silently patch around a stale decision. A chain of workarounds is the anti-pattern.

### Code & process hygiene
- **No plan IDs in committed code** (`TODO(A-5)`, "Phase A"). Write the *invariant* a future
  change enforces, not the plan task that schedules it. The plan is ephemeral; the code is durable.
- **Progress/status logs are fact-only, past-tense** — write `Committed X` only *after* it lands.
  Future-tense verbs in a DONE section read as false completion claims.
- **`Cargo.lock` discipline**: stage the root `Cargo.lock` in the *same* commit as any
  `Cargo.toml` dep change (`cargo check --workspace --locked` must pass per-commit). On a rebase
  lock conflict, `git checkout --theirs Cargo.lock` + `cargo check` to regenerate — don't
  `cargo update -p` (it drifts transitive deps to semver-minimum and trips dependency-review).
- **Local hooks mirror CI**: pre-push must run every required CI check (fmt, clippy, doctests,
  `--all-features`, `--no-default-features`, MSRV, `doc -D warnings`, taplo). Never let them diverge.
- **Intra-doc links**: under `rustdoc -D warnings`, don't use bracketed `[`path`]` in `//!`/
  attribute docs unless the path is in scope; verify with **default** features (a feature-gated
  link resolves under `--features X` but breaks the default-feature CI doc gate). Prefer plain
  `` `code` `` spans there.
- **Don't mix modes**: if the task is docs/ADR work, write the document only — don't also land
  code fixes in the same pass unless asked. "Continue on autopilot" inside a docs thread means
  keep working on docs.
- **Decide-or-defer, never half-implement**: don't ship pseudocode that depends on a deferred
  subsystem. Either implement fully (with the scaffolding it needs) or reject at validation with
  a pointer to the milestone that will do it.
- **Mark extensible public enums `#[non_exhaustive]`** as a one-time retrofit when a change adds
  variants — prevents future workspace-wide break-on-add.

### Dispatch & verification
- **Frame every dispatched subagent as a Senior Rust expert** on the current toolchain (edition
  2024; verify the current stable version from official Rust docs/release notes), with
  book-grade depth (Programming Rust, Rust for Rustaceans, Atomics and Locks,
  the Performance Book, the Nomicon for unsafe). An unframed agent defaults to generic-LLM
  mediocrity and earns a re-review. Quote idioms by name (newtype, typestate, RAII guards).
- **The orchestrator catches sloppy work before the human sees it.** If a sub-agent returns weak
  or incomplete output, send it back with corrections — don't pass weak results up for review.
- **Verify for real**: `cargo build/clippy -D warnings/test` (and miri for unsafe) green, output
  cited — never substitute "probably/likely" for running it. When corrected on the same thing
  2+ times, stop and re-read the plan rather than piling on more context.
